from django.db.models import signals as signalmodule


class Signals(object):
    '''
    Convenient wrapper for working with Django's signals (or any other
    implementation using same API).

    Example of usage::


       # connect to registered signal
       @signals.post_save(sender=YourModel)
       def sighandler(instance, **kwargs):
           pass

       # connect to any signal
       signals.register_signal(siginstance, signame) # and then as in example above

       or 
        
       @signals(siginstance, sender=YourModel)
       def sighandler(instance, **kwargs):
           pass

    In any case defined function will remain as is, without any changes.
